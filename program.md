__Abstract.__ TBD

__Bio.__ Dr. Ian Soboroff is a computer scientist and leader of the Retrieval Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Retrieval Group organizes the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), the Text Analysis Conference (TAC), and the TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID). These are all large, community-based research workshops that drive the state-of-the-art in information retrieval, video search, web search, information extraction, text summarization and other areas of information access. He has co-authored many publications in information retrieval evaluation, test collection building, text filtering, collaborative filtering, and intelligent software agents. His current research interests include building test collections for social media environments and nontraditional retrieval tasks.

## LLMs as Rankers, Raters, and Rewarders

__Abstract.__ In this talk, I will discuss recent advancements in the application of large language models (LLMs) to ranking, rating, and reward modeling, particularly in the context of information retrieval tasks. I will emphasize the fundamental similarities among these problems, highlighting that they essentially address the same underlying issue but through different approaches. Based on this observation, I propose several research questions that offer promising avenues for future exploration.

__Bio.__ Donald Metzler is a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google Inc. Prior to that, he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California (USC) and a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo!. He has served as the Program Chair of the WSDM, ICTIR, and OAIR conferences and sat on the editorial boards of all the major journals in his field. He has published over 100 research papers, has been awarded 9 patents, and is a co-author of "Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice". He currently leads a research group focused on a variety of problems at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval.
